# Can you change the values inside a list which is containedin set S?

s = {8, 7, 12, "Mohan", [1, 2]}

# No, you cannot change the values inside a list contained in a set in Python. The reason is that sets in Python require their elements to be immutable (i.e., hashable). Lists, being mutable, cannot be elements of a set, as they are not hashable.
